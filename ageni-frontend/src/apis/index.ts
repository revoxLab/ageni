Messi‚Äôs play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United‚Äôs Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon d‚ÄôOr. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final‚Äîthe team‚Äôs third consecutive finals loss in a major tournament‚ÄîMessi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived ‚Äúretirement‚Äù lasted less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team.

however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jos√© Altafini\'s record from the 1962‚Äì63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd M√ºller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of C√©sar Rodr√≠guez\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\'s individual form, Barcelona\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola ‚Äì one of the greatest eras in the club\'s history ‚Äì drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alc√°ntara\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Cl√°sico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di St√©fano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atl√©tico Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164]",\n            "score": 0.97579,\n            "raw_content": null\n        },\n        {\n            "title": "The life and times of Lionel Messi",\n            "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4783674/2023/08/18/lionel-messi-profile-soccer/",\n            "content": "For Messi, it is major trophy number 44..
